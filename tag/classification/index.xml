      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was about Winter break of my third year (Dec, 2018) and I wanted to venture out in the field of Natural Language Processing.
I took this project up from a basic Kaggle competition and used the sample solution in the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I imported the code into my local machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t run it but understood each line in a top to bottom fashion. From text pre-processing to the concept of word vectors, bag of words and finally word2vec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t just use that one list of code but also read blogs and watched videos on how these basic linguistics were implemented and conceptualised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I wrote each line of code myself, ran it, de-bugged it, played with it and pushed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learnings&#34;&gt;Learnings:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This project was aimed at understanding the foundations of NLP: tokens, pre-processing segments and the concept of vectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned two different approaches to vectorise words and sentences : bag of words and word2vec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These may seem insignificant in the longer run for the trivial concepts they are, but at the time of this project I was proud that instead of spending months on a course with no practical understanding of the fundamentals and implementation of a methodology, I instead learned the concepts in a practical way in just 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project code is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ShreyaGupta08/Movie-Reviewer-using-Word2Vec&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
